## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#774](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/774) [`b628a4d`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/b628a4da5fd21184922c6944059768d1ed6071d4) - New provider-agnostic sandbox layer so harness adapters can run **inside** isolated sandboxes.
  - **`@tanstack/ai-sandbox`** — `defineSandbox()` (lazy controller + resume→restoreSnapshot→create+bootstrap ensure algorithm), `withSandbox()` middleware, `defineWorkspace()` (git/local source, package-manager detection, setup, skills, secrets), `defineSandboxPolicy()`, the `SandboxProvider`/`SandboxHandle`/`SandboxCapabilities` contracts, capability tokens (`SandboxCapability` plus the optional `SandboxStore`/`Locks` persistence seams with in-memory defaults), `bootstrapWorkspace`, `createExecBackedGit`, `spawnNdjson` (run an agent CLI in a sandbox and stream its NDJSON stdout), the host MCP tool-proxy bridge (`startHostToolBridge` — exposes `chat()` server tools to the in-sandbox agent, with an optional permission-prompt tool), and the shared interactive-approval primitives (`resolveApproval`, `approvalId`, `buildApprovalRequestedEvent`) harness adapters use to enforce a policy and surface `approval-requested` events for client-in-the-loop approvals.
  - **`@tanstack/ai-sandbox-local-process`** — `localProcessSandbox()`: runs the agent on the host through the uniform `SandboxHandle` (no isolation; the fast dev loop).
  - **`@tanstack/ai-sandbox-docker`** — `dockerSandbox()`: runs the agent inside an isolated Docker container (dockerode), with commit-based snapshots, fork, and resume-by-id.
  - **`@tanstack/ai`** — `TextOptions.capabilities` exposes the middleware capability context to adapters so harness adapters that declare `requires: [...]` can read provided capabilities from `chatStream`; `TextOptions.approvals` threads client approval decisions through to adapters for the interactive-approval (deny + `approval-requested` + re-run) flow; `DefinedChatMiddleware` and `AnyChatMiddleware` are now exported for portable middleware authoring.

### Patch Changes

- [#774](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/774) [`b628a4d`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/b628a4da5fd21184922c6944059768d1ed6071d4) - Declarative sandbox provisioning + faster headless init.
  - **`createSecrets`**: type-safe secret references; underlying values are stored
    in a non-enumerable symbol-keyed registry and never written to snapshots, the
    sandbox store, or the event log. Use `secret: secrets.GH` in `gitSkill` for
    private-repo auth and `bearer(secrets.GH)` in MCP header values.
  - **Declarative `skills` / `plugins` / `instructions`**: `agentSkill`,
    `gitSkill` (private-repo clone with `secret`), `mcpSkill` (MCP server with
    resolved header values), and `fileSkill` are projected per harness into each
    CLI's native format (Claude Code `.mcp.json`, Codex `.codex/config.toml`,
    OpenCode `opencode.json`). `instructions` is written
    as a canonical `AGENTS.md` at the workspace root; `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md`
    are symlinked (copy fallback). Concepts a CLI lacks emit a warning and are
    skipped rather than throwing.
  - **Shallow clone by default**: `githubRepo`/`gitSource` default to
    `--depth 1 --single-branch`. Pass `depth: number` for a specific history
    depth or `depth: 'full'` to disable the flag.
  - **Serial/parallel `setup` callback**: `setup` accepts a plain `Array<string>`
    (all serial) or a `({ serial, parallel }) => void` callback that records
    groups run over a persistent shell — the shell's cwd and env carry over
    between serial steps; `parallel([...])` launches commands concurrently
    using the shell's forked state.
  - **Default snapshot-after-setup**: when the provider supports snapshots,
    bootstrap takes one automatically after `setup` completes. Add
    `lifecycle.snapshotMaxAge` (e.g. `'24h'`) to re-create the sandbox when the
    snapshot is older than the TTL.
  - **`@tanstack/ai-sandbox-docker` fix**: a spawned process's demuxed
    stdout/stderr now end on the exec stream's `close`/`error` (not only `end`),
    so disposing a long-lived process (e.g. the bootstrap shell) no longer hangs
    after `kill()`.

- [#774](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/774) [`b628a4d`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/b628a4da5fd21184922c6944059768d1ed6071d4) - Serverless/edge run model for the sandbox layer — a trigger can start an agent run and return immediately while a durable orchestrator drives it and clients tail the stream from a resumable cursor.
  - **Resumable run event-log** (`RunEventLog`, `InMemoryRunEventLog`, `RunEvent`, `RunRecord`, `isTerminalRunStatus`) — an append-only, `seq`-indexed log of a run's `StreamChunk`s with replay-then-tail reads. A dropped connection, a new tab, or an orchestrator that hibernated between chunks all reconnect by passing their last-seen `seq`. The run never depends on a single open connection.
  - **Run driver** (`pipeToRunLog`, `RunController`) — pumps a `chat()` stream into a `RunEventLog` (status transitions, RUN_ERROR capture, abort handling), and a controller that starts a run without blocking, exposes a resumable `attach(runId, { fromSeq })`, and `drain()`s in-flight runs for `waitUntil`-style flushing.
  - **Transport-agnostic tool-bridge** — the MCP tool-proxy is split into a portable core (`createToolBridgeCore`, `handleBridgeJsonRpc`) and a transport. `startHostToolBridge` remains the `node:http` host transport (now loopback-bound unless a Docker container must reach it, with a constant-time bearer check); a serverless/edge orchestrator serves the same core from its own `fetch` handler — no raw TCP listener. A new `ToolBridgeProvisioner` capability (`getToolBridgeProvisioner` / `provideToolBridgeProvisioner`, default `nodeHttpBridgeProvisioner`) lets the orchestrator inject the transport.
  - **Harness adapters inverted** — `claude-code`, `codex`, and `opencode` now resolve their tool-bridge from the `ToolBridgeProvisioner` capability (defaulting to the host transport) instead of hardcoding `node:http`, so they run unchanged on the host and on the edge.
  - **Claude Code runs on the Cloudflare sandbox** — a new required `SandboxCapabilities.writableStdin` flag lets a provider advertise whether spawned processes have a writable host→process stdin — `true` for the host/Docker/local-process providers, `false` for Cloudflare. The Claude Code adapter detects `false` and delivers the prompt via a file + in-shell stdin-redirection (`claude -p … < file`) instead of a host stdin write, keeping it out of argv. Host/Docker behaviour is unchanged (stdin path).
  - **Tool-bridge token hardening** — the per-run bearer token is no longer passed inline in argv. The Claude Code adapter writes the bridge MCP config to a file and passes claude the path (`--mcp-config <file>`), so the token can't be read from `ps` / `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` by other processes in the sandbox.
  - **Co-located ("combined") run model** — new `@tanstack/ai-sandbox` exports (`remoteToolStubs`, `toolDescriptors`, `httpRemoteToolExecutor`, `executeHostTool`, plus the `RemoteToolExecutor` interface) let the harness loop AND its MCP tool-bridge run INSIDE the container (the in-container sandbox is just `local-process`, with native stdin + a localhost `node:http` bridge). The orchestrator serializes its tools with `toolDescriptors`; the container rebuilds them as delegating stubs with `remoteToolStubs(descriptors, httpRemoteToolExecutor(url, token))`; the orchestrator answers that one call with `executeHostTool(tools, name, args)`. Only host-tool **execution** crosses the container→orchestrator boundary — the MCP transport itself never leaves the container, shrinking the public surface from the whole MCP protocol to a single authenticated tool-exec call.
  - **Request-derived callback hosts, split into bridge vs preview (`resolveBridgeOrigin` / `resolvePreviewHost`)** — the off-isolate sandbox container reaches the Worker over two distinct surfaces, now resolved separately (both exported from `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-cloudflare/agent`; the Worker captures the trigger host as `StartRunInput.publicHost`):
    - **Bridge / tool-exec** (container → Worker): `PUBLIC_HOSTNAME` is **optional** — unset → derived from the `POST /runs` request, which is safe on Cloudflare (the edge only routes hostnames you own to your Worker, so the request host is never an attacker's `Host` and the per-run bearer token can't be steered off-domain). A `*.workers.dev` deploy needs no config; **local dev uses `host.docker.internal`** (the Docker host gateway), so agent runs work locally with **no tunnel**.
    - **Preview** (browser → Worker → container, `exposePort`): a separate `PREVIEW_HOSTNAME`, because preview URLs require **wildcard DNS**. **Local** uses `*.localhost` (browser-resolved to loopback — previews work locally with no tunnel); **deployed** requires a **custom domain** with a `*.<domain>` route. `*.workers.dev` has no wildcard subdomains (the SDK's `exposePort` rejects it), so `resolvePreviewHost` throws a clear error pointing at `PREVIEW_HOSTNAME` rather than returning a dead URL.
  - **Preview wiring is package-provided, not example glue** — `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-cloudflare/agent` now exports `exposePreviewTool(input, env)` (a ready-made `exposePreview` `chat()` server tool) and `PREVIEW_GUIDANCE` (an app-agnostic system prompt), and `createCloudflareSandboxAgent` gains a `systemPrompts` option (do-drives) to wire the guidance in. The tool mints previews via a **Cloudflare quick tunnel** (`sandbox.tunnels.get(port)` → `*.trycloudflare.com`), served by `cloudflared` inside the sandbox — deliberately NOT `exposePort` + `proxyToSandbox`, which routes the preview through the Worker origin (in local dev, your Vite dev server, whose middleware then serves the preview's `/@vite/client` / `/src/*` / `/@fs/*` from the host instead of the container and breaks the page). A tunnel bypasses the Vite port, needs no custom domain on a deploy, and forwards WebSockets (HMR works). `PREVIEW_GUIDANCE` just tells the agent to bind wide and allow all hosts so the tunnel hostname is accepted (Vite `server: { host: true, allowedHosts: true }`). Because `sandbox.tunnels` exists only on the SDK's **RPC** transport (it throws `requires the RPC transport` on the default `http`), `cloudflareSandbox` now defaults to `transport: 'rpc'` (new `transport` config option to override) and applies it to create/resume/destroy; `exposePreviewTool` obtains its stub with `transport: 'rpc'` too. `exposePort` + `resolvePreviewHost` remain available for Worker-fronted previews on a custom domain. Adds `zod` as a peer dependency.
  - **`@tanstack/ai-sandbox-cloudflare` ships the runtime, not just the example** — the Worker router, the coordinator Durable Object, the durable run-log, and the `POST /run` wire contract are now package code, exported from two entries: `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-cloudflare/agent` (Workers-only — `createCloudflareSandboxAgent`, the coordinator base classes, `DurableObjectRunEventLog`, plus the shared `ContainerRunRequest` + `parseContainerRunRequest`), and `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-cloudflare/runner` (Node — `runInContainerHarness`, the in-container `chat()` server that validates the request, builds `chat()` over `localProcessSandbox()`, and streams NDJSON back). An app supplies only its config + an adapter resolver: the co-located example's whole worker + container program collapse to ~14 lines. Adds `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-local-process` as a peer dependency (used by the `/runner` entry).

  See `examples/sandbox-cloudflare` for the Worker → Durable Object → Container reference — a TanStack Start app that ships the UI, the agent, the coordinator DO, and the container in one Worker (trigger returns immediately; the DO coordinates, persists to a DO-backed `RunEventLog`, serves the bridge from its `fetch` handler, and streams to clients over a hibernatable WebSocket). The co-located variant (harness + bridge in the container; only `executeHostTool` crosses back) is a supported package mode — `createCloudflareSandboxAgent({ mode: 'colocated' })` plus a one-`runInContainerHarness`-call container program — documented in `docs/sandbox/overview.md`.
