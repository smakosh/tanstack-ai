### Minor Changes

- [#955](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/955) [`7c7aa09`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/7c7aa09a7402b45e6285ebc78a606131aec3e288) - Resumable streams: reconnect to an in-flight SSE **or NDJSON** response without
  re-running the provider.

  `toServerSentEventsResponse` and `toHttpResponse` both accept a
  `durability: { adapter, batch }` option. The adapter (`StreamDurability`)
  records every chunk to an ordered log before delivery and tags each event with
  an opaque, adapter-owned offset — an SSE `id:` line, or the `id` of an NDJSON
  `{ id, chunk }` envelope (NDJSON has no native event-id). A reconnect
  (`Last-Event-ID`) or an explicit `?offset` read replays strictly after that
  offset from the log — the lazy provider stream is never iterated on resume.
  Producers terminalize the log on cancellation and failure (`RUN_ERROR` append
  - `close()`) and on completion when the source stream emits its own terminal
    event (`chat()` always does), so readers are never parked on a dead run.

  Two adapters ship: `memoryStream(request)` in `@tanstack/ai` (process-local,
  for development and tests) and the new `@tanstack/ai-durable-stream` package,
  a Durable Streams protocol adapter for production backends.

  For the `GET` handler that a reload or a second tab reconnects to,
  `resumeServerSentEventsResponse({ adapter })` and `resumeHttpResponse({ adapter })`
  replay a run straight from the durability log. They need no producer stream and
  return a 400 when the request carries no resume offset.

  On the client, all four HTTP adapters are now resumable — `fetchServerSentEvents`,
  `fetchHttpStream`, `xhrServerSentEvents`, and `xhrHttpStream`. Each tracks the
  per-event offset, auto-reconnects with `Last-Event-ID`, de-duplicates the
  replayed prefix, and exposes `joinRun(runId)` to attach to an in-flight or
  finished run from the start (read-only GET with `offset=-1`). Untagged streams
  behave exactly as before. A durable run that ends with no terminal event and no
  forward progress now throws `DurableStreamIncompleteError` instead of hanging.

  Reconnection and durability are bounded so failures surface rather than hang or
  loop:
  - `memoryStream` evicts completed logs after a grace window (unbounded growth
    is gone); resuming an expired/unknown run throws, and a from-start join to a
    run that never produces fails after `MemoryStreamOptions.firstChunkDeadlineMs`.
  - all four HTTP adapters accept `reconnect: { maxAttempts, delayMs }` — a
    throttle plus a ceiling on CONSECUTIVE no-progress reconnects (default 5;
    forward progress resets it) that fails with the new `StreamReconnectLimitError`
    instead of reconnecting endlessly, without penalizing a healthy long-lived run.
  - `durableStream` accepts `reconnect: { maxReadFailures, delayMs }` to bound its
    read-retry loop, and `server` is now optional when `fetch` is provided (e.g. a
    Cloudflare service binding).
  - `toServerSentEventsResponse` accepts `debug` to record durability terminal /
    close failures server-side, where a replaying joiner cannot observe them.
