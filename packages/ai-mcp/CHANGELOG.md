## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- [#984](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/984) [`4ab149f`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/4ab149fd46a1cf55691266cdd118fdc9999c0b2a) - **Make every bundled Agent Skill discoverable by TanStack Intent.**

  Intent finds skills by scanning `node_modules` for packages that carry the
  `tanstack-intent` keyword, and can only load what npm actually publishes. Three
  packages shipped skills that failed one half of that contract:
  - `@tanstack/ai-mcp` wrote its skill into a `skills/` directory that was missing
    from `files`, so it was never published at all.
  - `@tanstack/ai-memory` and `@tanstack/ai-sandbox` published their skills but
    lacked the keyword, so Intent never looked at them.

  All three now publish `skills` and carry the keyword, matching `@tanstack/ai`,
  `@tanstack/ai-code-mode`, and `@tanstack/ai-persistence`.

  The client persistence skill also moves from `@tanstack/ai-persistence` to
  `@tanstack/ai` as `ai-core/client-persistence`. It teaches
  `localStoragePersistence` / `sessionStoragePersistence` / `indexedDBPersistence`
  and the `persistence` option on `useChat` — all of which live in the framework
  packages, not in `@tanstack/ai-persistence`. An app doing browser-only
  persistence never installs that package, so the guidance was unreachable for
  exactly the people who needed it, and `ai-core` routed to a path that did not
  exist on disk. Skills now follow the code that owns them.

### Minor Changes

- [#843](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/843) [`c1a8732`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/c1a87327b4a3463d37158f32ca90184b5fd092bb) - feat: MCP Apps support — render interactive `ui://` widgets served by MCP servers

  Adds support for the ratified [MCP Apps](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/extensions/apps/overview) standard, letting MCP server tools return interactive UI widgets that render in the chat.
  - **`@tanstack/ai`** — MCP tool results that link a `ui://` resource (via `_meta.ui.resourceUri`) now surface as a new `UIResourcePart` on the assistant `UIMessage` (carried as an AG-UI `CUSTOM` event). The widget never enters model input. The `ui://` resource is read eagerly during the run, fail-soft.
  - **`@tanstack/ai-mcp`** — tool discovery now captures `serverId` + the UI resource link; `MCPClient` gains a public `callTool` and `getInfo()` (returns the client's transport descriptor); `MCPClients` gains `getServers()` (returns all pool entries' descriptors). New `@tanstack/ai-mcp/apps` subpath exports `createMcpAppCallHandler` — a server-side tool-call proxy for interactive widgets that takes the MCP client(s)/pool you already created (`clients: MCPClient | MCPClients | Array<MCPClient | MCPClients>`), reads each client's transport descriptor via `MCPClient.getInfo()` / `MCPClients.getServers()` (pure config, no live socket required), and **reconnects per call** (stateless, serverless-safe by default, same-server allowlist). Also exports an in-memory `McpSessionStore` seam for stateful transports.
  - **`@tanstack/ai-client`** — `createMcpAppBridge`, a framework-agnostic bridge routing widget tool-calls to the call handler, follow-up prompts into the chat, and blocking links unless a handler is supplied.
  - **`@tanstack/ai-react` / `@tanstack/ai-preact`** — a `MCPAppResource` component (new `./mcp-apps` subpath) that renders a `UIResourcePart` via `@mcp-ui/client`'s `AppRenderer` (optional peer dependency), wired to the bridge. Plus a `useMcpAppBridge` hook (main entry) that returns a stable `createMcpAppBridge` for a given `threadId`/`callEndpoint` while always calling the latest `sendMessage`/`onLink`.

  Persistence is intentionally out of scope (in-memory seams only); Solid/Vue/Svelte/Angular renderers are deferred (the renderer SDK is currently React-only).

### Patch Changes

- [#844](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/844) [`a6cceba`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/a6cceba4812e7e986183ee856112fcf5f8fa12ff) - Republish all packages with their compiled `dist/` output.

  Releases `0.33.0`–`0.36.0` were published without a `dist/` directory: the
  release workflow relied on an Nx-cached `build` whose outputs were not
  materialized to disk before `changeset publish` packed the tarballs, and
  `files: ["dist"]` silently includes nothing when `dist/` is absent. The
  published packages therefore contained only `src/`, so every export
  (`./dist/esm/*.js`) resolved to a missing file and the packages were
  uninstallable.

  The publish step now runs a fresh, cache-bypassing build of all packages
  immediately before publishing, guaranteeing compiled artifacts are present in
  every tarball.

The CLI ships as an ESM bundle with `json-schema-to-typescript` inlined, which uses CJS `require()` internally. Enabling tsup's `shims` option injects a `createRequire(import.meta.url)` shim so those `require()` calls resolve correctly.

Discover and run MCP server tools (and read resources/prompts) inside any adapter's `chat()` loop, with three type-safety modes (auto-discovery, hand-written `toolDefinition()` binding, and generated end-to-end types via `npx @tanstack/ai-mcp generate`). Includes `createMCPClients` for connecting to multiple servers with auto-prefixed tool names. Also exposes `abortSignal` on `ToolExecutionContext` so long-running tools (e.g. MCP `callTool`) cancel with the chat run.
